 In addition to a course layout Racetrack files contain information about the length of the course as well as its breakdown into course segments. Segmented racetracks are used by a number of analytic functions in WinDarab.

 Single racetrack files can contain multiple segmentations. Because of this Darab shows racetrack files as folders and the different segmentations as files.
