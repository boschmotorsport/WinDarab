|Area  |  Refers to the horizontal division of a Oscilloscope in which channel signals are displayed.|
|Base Directory | A Base Directory represents a link to a particular folder on the hard drive (--> network). WinDarab saves data in sub-folders within a specified base directory.|
|Base Directory for Calculating Differences | Logged Data Directory that provides channel values (for the second channel) for calculating a difference.|
|Bit Area | See Area|
|CAN | **C**ontroller **A**rea **N**etwork|
|CanCard | Most commonly used hardware for data recording. A more recent device is CardMemory.|
|Channels | Separate data signals within a recording.|
|Conditions | A condition is a linked set of mathematical criteria that must be met in a specific sample in order for that data sample to be included in an evaluation.|
|Configuration | A particular arrangement of channels, which can be loaded and displayed in a Oscilloscope.|
|Darab Explorer | Darab Explorer is used in WinDarab to manage Racetrack and Logged Data Files.|
|Data Logger | Data Logging Device for Measurement Channels|
|Differences | The Differences Channel is a special channel that calculates values for the difference resulting from a comparison of the same channel in two different Logged Data Files.|
|DLS | Data Logging System (consists of C55 Data Logger and MSI Devices)|
|ECU | Engine Control Unit|
|Grid | Grid lines which can be displayed in a Oscilloscope. |
|Logged Data File | A Logged Data File contains all data recorded in a vehicle. |
