## Feedback Files

### Via WinDarab

Feedback files can be created by WinDarab in two ways. Both methods write the files to: **%WinDarab Install%/Minidump** folder location. If large data sets or desktops are open please give it some time, two zip files will be created for each feedback.

### Via Windows Task Manager

Feedback files can also be created by Windows by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** then right click on the WinDarab process and select **Create Dump File**. This will create a .dmp file in a location specified by Windows. This method is usually only requried if WinDarab is unable to make its own file or Bosch Motorsport requests the Windows crashdump.
