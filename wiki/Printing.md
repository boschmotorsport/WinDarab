|It could be possible that very fine lines will **not be displayed in the print preview.** This may be a result of a discrepancy between your screen and printer resolution.<br>The lines **will** be visible when printed.|
|If you choose your colors please consider that background colors will not be printed. For example light colors against a black background are easy to see on screen, but your printed output will be difficult to read.|

## Print Optons

Before a print job starts printing, or before the Print Preview appears on your screen, WinDarab will display a dialog box with printing options.
