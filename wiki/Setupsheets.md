# Setupsheets

In WinDarab vehicle setupsheets can be created and maintained to correlate data with car changes. Setupsheet values can be used in data analysis for viewing and calculations.

## What are setupsheets?

If a file is opened, WinDarab looks for the file “Setupsheet.xml” starting in the folder of the file and all folders up to the root. If a setupsheet is found, the setupsheet is applied to the file.

A setupsheet contains sections with CAR elements. A CAR element contains a file name pattern attribute which is used by WinDarab to determine which CAR element is used for a certain file.

A CAR element contains CHANNEL elements which are used to define virtual channels.

Each CHANNEL element contains one or more OUTING elements, which define the channels value for the given outing.

WinDarab is now creating/updating a virtual channel and puts the found outing value into this channel (at least at each beginning of a lap or file)

## Folder Layout Options

Example Folder Layout:

```
C:
└── Data
    └── 20190325 - Sebring
        ├── Chassis 1
        │   ├── Setupsheet.xml
        │   ├── Chassis 1 Outing 1.bmsbin
        │   └── Chassis 1 Outing 2.bmsbin
        └── Chassis 2
            ├── Setupsheet.xml
            ├── Chassis 2 Outing 1.bmsbin
            └── Chassis 2 Outing 2.bmsbin
```

Alternate Folder Layout:

```
C:
└── Data
    └── 20190325 - Sebring
        └── Setupsheet.xml
            ├── Chassis 1 Outing 1.bmsbin
            ├── Chassis 1 Outing 2.bmsbin
            ├── Chassis 2 Outing 1.bmsbin
            └── Chassis 2 Outing 2.bmsbin
```

## Setupsheet Creation

There are two main ways to create setupsheets.

1. Manually via the WinDarab Gui
2. Programmatically from an existing Excel sheet or other source (XML File).

### Manual Creation

To create a setupsheet:

- Click on the Setupsheet icon in the ribbon under _Tools &rarr; Mathematics_
- **Right Click** on the \<filename> in the _File Explorer_

|![Setupsheet Icon Location](images/Setupsheet&#32;Open&#32;GUI.jpg)|Or|![From the File Explorer](images/File&#32;Explorer&#32;Setupsheet.jpg)|
|---|---|---|

This will open the setupsheet creation and editing interface. Rename your setupsheet as desired then click to add channels.

![Setupsheet Name Channels](images/Setupsheet&#32;Filename&#32;Add.jpg)

Add and configure properties for all channels to be used. Channels can be added or edited later from the same window.

![Setupsheet Channel Properties](images/Setupsheet&#32;Channel&#32;Properties.jpg)

To finish inserting initial values add an outing, add setupsheet values, and Save & Close.

![Setupsheet Outing Values](images/Setupsheet&#32;Outing&#32;Value&#32;Save.jpg)

### Programmatic Creation

#### Notes

- The hierarchical order of CHANNEL and OUTING elements can be switched.

- Currently there’s no UI to edit the “Setupsheet.xml” this will come in the future.

- If a persistent virtual channel is defined by the setup sheet, WinDarab checks and (if necessary) updates the saved channel data.

- Changes to the setupsheet.xml are automatically detected and used to update the virtual channels immediately!

The following attributes are supported:
|Attribute|Property|Description
|---|---|---|
|CAR|Filename|Filename pattern (with wildcards “*” or “?”) to select the node for a file.|
|CHANNEL|Name|Name of the (virtual) channel|
||Unit|Unit of the (virtual) channel)|
||Format|Number format (Len.Dec), The numbers are 10-based.|
||Min|Default y-axis view minimum|
||Max|Default y-axis view maximum|
||Persistent|If True, the virtual channel is saved to the file.|

Note:

- To match all files use the _Filename pattern_: '*'

#### Example XML Format

```
<!-- One way -->
<SETUPSHEET>
  <CAR Filename="Chassis 3*">
    <CHANNEL Name="packer_fl" Unit="mm" Format="5.2" Min="18" Max="20" Persistent="True">
      <OUTING Value="108">18.5</OUTING>
      <OUTING Value="109">19.3</OUTING>
      <OUTING Value="106">19.2</OUTING>
    </CHANNEL>
    <CHANNEL Name="packer_fr" Unit="mm" Format="5.2" Persistent="True">
      <OUTING Value="107">18.5</OUTING>
      <OUTING Value="108">19.5</OUTING>
    </CHANNEL>
    <CHANNEL Name="packer_rl" Unit="mm" Format="5.1" Persistent="True">
      <OUTING Value="108">19.5</OUTING>
      <OUTING Value="109">19.2</OUTING>
    </CHANNEL>
    <CHANNEL Name="packer_rr" Unit="mm" Format="6.3" Persistent="True">
      <OUTING Value="107">18.5</OUTING>
      <OUTING Value="108">19.5</OUTING>
      <OUTING Value="109">19.2</OUTING>
    </CHANNEL>
  </CAR>
</SETUPSHEET>
```

```
<!-- Other way -->
<SETUPSHEET>
  <CAR Filename="Chassis 3*">
    <OUTING Value="107" >
      <CHANNEL Name="packer_fl2" Unit="mm" Persistent="True">18.5</CHANNEL>
      <CHANNEL Name="packer_fr2" Unit="mm" Persistent="True">18.5</CHANNEL>
      <CHANNEL Name="packer_rl2" Unit="mm" Persistent="True">18.5</CHANNEL>
      <CHANNEL Name="packer_rr2" Unit="mm" Persistent="True">18.5</CHANNEL>
    </OUTING>
    <OUTING Value="108" Persistent="True">
      <CHANNEL Name="packer_fl2">18.0</CHANNEL>
      <CHANNEL Name="packer_fr2">18.0</CHANNEL>
    </OUTING>
  <CAR>
</SETUPSHEET>
```

## Using Setupsheet Channels For Data Analysis

For the Setupsheet values to be used in data analysis two conditions must be met:

1. The setupsheet CAR attribute _Filename_ must match the BMSBIN file name. Wildcards can be insterted with asterisks (\*). Screenshots in the Manual Creation section show the _Filename_ as **"\*Data 1"**, this allows files whose name ends with **"Data 1"** to match with the setupsheet

2. The setupsheet file must contain the outing number to match the dataset outing number. Outing numbers can be manually edited in the Setupsheet GUI by clicking on an outing number. An outing number value of '0' can be used as a 'global' or 'default' value for the setupsheet

### Using Values in Plots and Math

Setupsheet channels shown as **"Virtual Channels"**, persistence can be set with the channel properties. These Virtual Channels can be used the same as all other virtual channels in functions, conditions, and plots.

### Changing existing Setupsheets

Setupsheets can be updated by opening the Setupsheet GUI and clicking on values to be changed. Channels and outings can be edited, added, or deleted at any time.

## Example: Setupsheets & Telemetry

As of **WinDarab 7.7.003**, Setupsheets can be used with Telemetry

Prerequisites:

1. Setupsheet file must exist in the **%WinDarab Install Directory% / Config / WDServer** directory
    - The easiest way to do this is to use *File Explorer &rarr; Setupsheet*
    - ![From the File Explorer](images/File&#32;Explorer&#32;Setupsheet.jpg)
2. WinDarab needs to know what Outing and Lap **Special Channels** your telemetry stream is using.
    - These are *probably* **laptrigger_outcnt_dls** and **laptrigger_lapcurr_dls**
    - ![Outing Counter Special Channels](images/Special%20Channels%20%20-%20Setupsheet%20Outing.png)
    - ![Lap Counter Special Channels](images/Special%20Channels%20%20-%20Setupsheet%20Lap.png)

Verify your special channels settings are correct **with your telemetry stream connected** if your File Explorer looks similar to this:
