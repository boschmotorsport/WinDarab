## Darab Ribbon

WinDarab menu and toolbars are organized in a Ribbon. The Ribbon is designed to help you quickly find commands and perform tasks. The commands are grouped logical together and placed in a tab. Darab Ribbon consists at least the following tabs:
 
1. [Start](#start)
2. [Tools](#tools)
3. [Windows](#windows)

### [Start](#start)
The tool tabs on the Start tab depend on which analysis window is currently active. If no analysis window is opened the Start tab contains the following tool tabs (see chapter Analysis and Oscilloscope)

* Desktop

* Settings
<p align="center">

When at least one analysis window is opened the analysis window specific tool tabs will be displayed right of the Settings tool tab.

For example here are the tool tabs of the oscilloscope:

</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Dockable window</b></td>
<td>Dockable window is the standard option. In this state, your Racetrack window is docked wherever you chose and can be handled like explained in The Racetrack Window.</td>
</tr><tr> 
<td><b>Transparent window</b></td>
<td>The transparent window is activated when you click on it or when you drag the docking racetrack window and drop it somewhere without docking it.
As soon as the window loses the focus, its background disappears and all you see is the racetrack.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/Transparent Racetrack.jpg">
</p>

You can move the racetrack by **CTRL + left click** and drag to another location.

Alternatively, you can move your cursor over the racetrack and hover for one second to display the background again. Then the racetrack can be moved by dragging the window.
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td><b>Hidden</b></td>
<td>The last option is to hide the Racetrack window completely.
  </td></tr>
</table>

###### Hint:
* You can quickly switch through all the states by clicking on Windows &rarr; Dockable windows &rarr; Racetrack.

* Click with the left mouse button on **Windows &rarr; All controls &rarr; Tile** to make all analysis windows on the current worksheet be tiled to the samedimensions 
 
##### Hint:
* When you hide the caption of a single window while your other windows still have the caption shown, the Show captions button will be unchecked. You can click on the Show captions button now to show all captions again or press the button two times to hide all captions.
 
#### Current control
 
The Current control tab allows you to adjust the current active control

* Click with the left mouse button on **Windows &rarr; Current control &rarr; Show caption** to change the visibility of your current active control.

##### Hint/Hidden Gem:
* When you click on Toggle for the first time, the docks won’t be visible. You can now adjust your workspace. Both workspaces will be saved when you close WinDarab, so they are still the same after the next start.
* This is commonly used as a 'Setup' layout and an 'Analysis' layout
    * Setup = Get your plots setup the way you like, load data, etc
    * Analysis = remove any extraneous windows and just look at data with maximum screen pixels
